GWEN4COENGINE - GUI Without Extravagant Nonsense, forked for use with my own engine

This is a fork of Garry Newman's GWEN gui library. It didn't look like he had touched it for a while so I decided to take matters
into my own hands and make my own version so I could more easily craft it to fit my purposes.
